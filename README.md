# CopyDedupFiles
PowerShell Script to deduplicate files from a root source and copy them to a destination mimicing a lightroom folder structure.

A quick script I wrote to help wrangle in the unorganized nature of my RAW pictures. It works enough for my purposes, but figured I'd share if anyone else kind find it useful.

Useage:
Copy-DedupFiles.ps1 [-Source] <string> [-Destination] <string> [[-Extensions] <string[]>]
